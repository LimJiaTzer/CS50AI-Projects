# CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python

This repository contains my solutions to the projects from Harvard's [CS50 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/). Each project showcases the application of core data structure and AI algorithms including search algorithms, knowledge representation, probabilistic models, optimization, machine learning, and natural language processing.
